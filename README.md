 ## **Motto: " WE Got You Covered "**

# üìà **Stock Prediction Model**
### **Predicting Stocks with ML**

**Stock Prediction Model is an ML-powered stock price prediction app built with Python and Streamlit. It utilizes machine learning models to forecast stock prices and help investors make data-driven decisions.**

# **üëì Quick OverView**

## **Model Deployment**
### - **Please check it over here: [üìàStock Prediction Model ](https://trend-pulse.streamlit.app/#tesla-stock-price-prediction)**
### - **To Run it effectively, with more crisp understanding: [Run On Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rhythm-shahane/Trend-Pulse/blob/main/Google_Colab.ipynb)**
### - **A Easier Presentation, has been linked here: [A Quickie](https://tome.app/rhythms-space-org/trend-pulse-navigating-tomorrows-markets-with-lstm-intelligence-clsknglyp08j6mu62chcpjx1a)**

# **üìäDataset Description**
The dataset provided is the historical stock market data of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). 
Here's a summary of its structure and key statistics:

## The Dataset Contains:
- Date: The date of the stock data, formatted as MM/DD/YYYY.
- Open: The price of the stock at the opening of the trading day.
- High: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
- Low: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
- Close: The closing price of the stock for the trading day.
- Volume: The number of shares traded during the trading day.
- Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, accounting for any corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, etc.

## Data Anaylsis:
### - There are 1,692 entries, indicating stock data for 1,692 trading days.
### - The dataset starts from June 29, 2010, with the first few entries showing significant volatility in the stock price and trading volume.
### - The Volume of shares traded also varies greatly, from as low as 118,500 to as high as 37,163,900, with a mean trading volume of around 4,270,741 shares.

## Dataset Split Info
The dataset is divided into training and validation sets as follows:
- **Training the model by some old data from the dataset.**
- **Validating data on the previous closing values from the dataset.**
- **Predicting data by using the trained model.**

# **üí°Approach**
### 1. First The Model fetch Dataset File (with an ext of .csv)
### 2. Secondly the Model understands the Data Injection By Kaggle
### 3. Then the data is cleaned and then trained
### 4. Training model on the closing values of each day from the dataset file.
### 5. The Lib like Numpy manipulates the array, along side Lib Panda Transforms and Visualises the Data.
### 6. The Lib Matplot, it plots the data, along with plotty for more reactive graphs.
### 7. Using Keras, Sequential, Dense & the most prominent LSTM model, we train the model layer by layer.
### 8. At the last the Output has been trained on the older data from the CSV file.
### 9. The Trained model gives the predicted the plotting with the valid values, 
### 10. Hence generated the final output of the next day closing value on the basis of previous 60 days.

# üèóÔ∏è **Dependences**
Trend Pulse is built with these core frameworks and modules:
- **Streamlit** - To create the web app UI and interactivity 
- **LSTM** - To build the Long Short Term Memory model
- **Plotly** - To create interactive financial charts

# ‚õ©Ô∏è **Workflow**
The app workflow is:

1. User feeds the CSV file.
2. Historical data is fetched with CSV file.
3. LSTM model is trained on the data 
4. Model makes multi-day price forecasts
5. Results are plotted with Plotly

# ‚ûº **Accuracy**
## We Use Root Mean Square Deviation:
